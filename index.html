<h1>Welcome to Van's Highly Advanced and Responsive Site</h1><p>

<p>Hey there, you've reached the personal site of Van Goodwin. You probably found this page because I gave you the URL or you were Googling me. Either way, please feel free to stay as long as you like and admire my advanced web development skills.</p>
<p>You can find me pretty easily just poking around, but sure I'll go ahead and make it easier for you. When I'm not running <a href="http://vanallenstrategies.com">my consulting firm</a> based in Washington, DC, I travel internationally as much as is feasible.</p>
<p>But nobody uses personal web sites to learn about people any more. So, you are welcome to stalk me elsewhere.</p>
